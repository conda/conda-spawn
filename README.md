## What is this?

`conda spawn` is a replacement subcommand for the `conda activate` and `conda deactivate` workflow

Instead of writing state to your current shell session, `conda spawn ENV-NAME` will start a new shell with your activated environment. To deactivate, exit the process with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd>, or run the command `exit`.

## Installation

This is a `conda` plugin and goes in the `base` environment:

```bash
conda install -n base conda-forge::conda-spawn
```

More information is available on our [documentation](https://conda.github.io/conda-spawn/).

## Supported shells

`conda-spawn` distinguishes two tiers of shell support:

- **Fully supported**: `bash`, `zsh`, `powershell`, `cmd`. Implemented in `conda_spawn.shell`. Covered by CI on every push and actively maintained.
- **Best-effort**: `fish`, `csh`/`tcsh`, `xonsh`. Implemented in `conda_spawn.contrib`. Provided to match `conda activate`'s own activator coverage so `conda-spawn` can replace it on systems that use those shells. They are lightly tested and we rely on user reports to catch shell-specific bugs.
