[//]: # (current developments)

## 0.2.0 (2026-08-31)

### Enhancements

* Add `conda shell` as an alias for `conda spawn`. (#59)
* Inject Fish and Xonsh activation through their documented startup options so
  activation completes before the first interactive prompt. (#36)

### Bug fixes

* Ensure spawned PowerShell sessions call `conda.exe` instead of the no-op
  `conda.bat` when running `conda activate` or `conda deactivate`. (#35)
* Import `CondaSubcommand` from `conda.plugins.types` so conda-spawn remains
  compatible after conda removes the deprecated `conda.plugins` re-export.
  (#38)
* Preserve native login startup files and logout behavior for POSIX shells,
  Bash, and Zsh while spawning an activated shell. (#36)
* Run Xonsh `on_post_rc` handlers before activation and readiness. (#36)
* Remove temporary activation scripts as soon as the spawned shell reports it
  is ready. (#36)
* Keep conda-spawn's nested-session marker out of conda's `CONDA_*`
  environment-variable namespace. (#36)

### Other

* Use conda's activator classes directly and retain only conda-spawn's `PATH`
  and environment-variable changes. (#45)
* Enable infrastructure-managed Dependabot configuration via
  conda/infrastructure templates. (#47)

### Docs

* Update project and documentation URLs after the repository moved to the
  `conda` organization.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added

- Best-effort support for `fish`, `csh`/`tcsh`, and `xonsh` shells
  ([#21], [#28]).
- New `conda_spawn.contrib` module for shell registration discovery and
  `conda_spawn.registry` module for the in-process shell registry.
- Public subclass extension hooks on `Shell`/`UnixShell` (the leading
  underscores were dropped) so out-of-tree plugins can extend behaviour
  without reaching into private API.
- Non-PTY unit tests for `UnixShell` alongside the existing PTY-based
  integration tests.
- Dependabot configuration for GitHub Actions, pre-commit, and pip.

### Changed

- Renamed `UnixTTYShell` to `UnixShell`.
- Modernized the supported Python versions to 3.10–3.14 and the matching
  CI matrix.
- CI now tests against `conda-forge` only; the `defaults` channel was
  dropped from the matrix.
- Tests were split to mirror the module layout (`shell` / `contrib` /
  `registry`) and parameterized with shared fixtures.

### Fixed

- Double shell prompt when spawning a new shell ([#22]).
- PowerShell `-NoExit` is now skipped when stdin is not a TTY ([#30]).
- `$CONDA_ROOT/condabin` stays first in `PATH` when replacing a prefix.
- Ready-marker synchronization is sourced from the activation script to
  avoid PTY echo leaks.

### Removed

- `spawn -n` / `spawn -p` mentions left over in the documentation.

## [0.0.5] - 2025-01-29

- Removed `-n, --name` and `-p, --prefix` flags in favour of a positional
  argument, mirroring `conda activate` ([#12]).

## [0.0.4] - 2025-01-20

- Prevent nested activation by default; opt in via `--replace` and
  `--stack` ([#6]).

## [0.0.3] - 2025-01-16

- Avoid `conda` in the base env getting shadowed by other `conda`
  executables on `PATH` ([#5]).

## [0.0.2] - 2025-01-15

- Added the `--hook` option ([#2]).
- Added the initial documentation site ([#3]).

## [0.0.1] - 2025-01-14

- Prototype release.
